# Solitude-OS
Manifest for Solitude-OS

## Getting started

To get started with Android/Solitude-OS, you'll need to get familiar with Repo and Version Control with Git.

To initialize your local repository using the Solitude trees, use a command like this:

`repo init -u git://github.com/solitude-os-odal/manifest.git -b master`

Then to sync up:

`repo sync`

Pull device tree and blobs in as required.

Setup build environment

`source build/envsetup.sh` or `. build/envsetup.sh`

`brunch <device name>`

Congratulations! You now have a build of Solitude OS!
